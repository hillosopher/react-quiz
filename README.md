# A React Quiz
A short React Quiz made in, well, React!

This is a simple React quiz I made to mainly practice my knowlege of the useReducer hook, among other elements of React and application-building in general:

- Componentized Infrastructure
- Context API
- hooks, particurly useState, useEffect, and useReducer
- Closures
